1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I just don't understand why she's never in the mood anymore

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, my wife used to be the same way

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:45,200
Really? What do you think it is? Well, it could be a number of different things, but um, let's rule out some obvious ones

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Or not the clipboard

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:01:19,400
Have you tried non-sexual affection? What? You know, like holding her, kissing her, touching her gently, instead of just randomly groping her

6
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:42,600
You know, touching her without any pressure for the bedroom, so she knows you value her more than just her body

7
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,400
My wife loves that stuff

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,200
Does yours? I don't know

9
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay, have you tried intentionally setting aside time to reconnect together? You know, schedule babysitter, surprise, or with a date be playful, talk about life and love, like you did when you were dating

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,800
And that's been really busy work lately

11
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Right

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Have you asked her if she feels overwhelmed with the mental load and the emotional labor of this family or the relationship? Were those real words? I don't speak Spanish

13
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,000
How about vulnerability? No

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Intimacy

15
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Stop saying words I don't know

16
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Emotional connection

17
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Okay, this isn't fair

18
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:58,800
You're making me out to be the bad guy in all this

19
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Remember, she's depriving me

20
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,600
Listen, I get it

21
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:19,800
I don't mean to make you out to be the bad guy

22
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm just trying to stretch your mind on what might be going on.
